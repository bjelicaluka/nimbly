A *room* is an arbitrary channel that sockets can `join` and `leave`. It can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients:

  }}

:::info

Please note that rooms are a **server-only** concept (i.e. the client does not have access to the list of rooms it has joined).

:::

## Joining and leaving

You can call `join` to subscribe the socket to a given channel:

```js
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  socket.join("some room");
});
```

And then simply use `to` or `in` (they are the same) when broadcasting or emitting:

```js
io.to("some room").emit("some event");
```

You can emit to several rooms at the same time:

```js
io.to("room1").to("room2").to("room3").emit("some event");
```

In that case, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory)">union</a> is performed: every socket that is at least in one of the rooms will get the event **once** (even if the socket is in two or more rooms).

You can also broadcast to a room from a given socket:

```js
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  socket.to("some room").emit("some event");
});
```

In that case, every socket in the room **excluding** the sender will get the event.

/>

To leave a channel you call `leave` in the same fashion as `join`.

## Default room

Each `Socket` in Socket.IO is identified by a random, unguessable, unique identifier [Socket#id](../02-Server/server-socket-instance.md#socketid). For your convenience, each socket automatically joins a room identified by its own id.

This makes it easy to implement private messages:

```js
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  socket.on("private message", (anotherSocketId, msg) => {
    socket.to(anotherSocketId).emit("private message", socket.id, msg);
  });
});
```

## Sample use cases

- broadcast data to each device / tab of a given user

```js
io.on("connection", async (socket) => {
  const userId = await fetchUserId(socket);

  socket.join(userId);

  // and then later
  io.to(userId).emit("hi");
});
```

- send notifications about a given entity

```js
io.on("connection", async (socket) => {
  const projects = await fetchProjects(socket);

  projects.forEach(project => socket.join("project:" + project.id));

  // and then later
  io.to("project:4321").emit("project updated");
});
```

## Disconnection

Upon disconnection, sockets `leave` all the channels they were part of automatically, and no special teardown is needed on your part.

You can fetch the rooms the Socket was in by listening to the `disconnecting` event:

```js
io.on("connection", socket => {
  socket.on("disconnecting", () => {
    console.log(socket.rooms); // the Set contains at least the socket ID
  });

  socket.on("disconnect", () => {
    // socket.rooms.size === 0
  });
});
```

## With multiple Socket.IO servers

Like [global broadcasting](broadcasting-events.md#with-multiple-socketio-servers), broadcasting to rooms also works with multiple Socket.IO servers.

You just need to replace the default [Adapter](../08-Miscellaneous/glossary.md#adapter) by the Redis Adapter. More information about it [here](../05-Adapters/adapter-redis.md).

## Implementation details

The "room" feature is implemented by what we call an Adapter. This Adapter is a server-side component which is responsible for:

- storing the relationships between the Socket instances and the rooms
- broadcasting events to all (or a subset of) clients

You can find the code of the default in-memory adapter [here](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-adapter).

Basically, it consists in two [ES6 Maps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map):

- `sids`: `Map<SocketId, Set<Room>>`
- `rooms`: `Map<Room, Set<SocketId>>`

Calling `socket.join("the-room")` will result in:

- in the Ì€`sids` Map, adding "the-room" to the Set identified by the socket ID
- in the `rooms` Map, adding the socket ID in the Set identified by the string "the-room"

Those two maps are then used when broadcasting:

- a broadcast to all sockets (`io.emit()`) loops through the `sids` Map, and send the packet to all sockets
- a broadcast to a given room (`io.to("room21").emit()`) loops through the Set in the `rooms` Map, and sends the packet to all matching sockets

You can access those objects with:

```js
// main namespace
const rooms = io.of("/").adapter.rooms;
const sids = io.of("/").adapter.sids;

// custom namespace
const rooms = io.of("/my-namespace").adapter.rooms;
const sids = io.of("/my-namespace").adapter.sids;
```

Notes:

- those objects are not meant to be directly modified, you should always use [`socket.join(...)`](../../server-api.md#socketjoinroom) and [`socket.leave(...)`](../../server-api.md#socketleaveroom) instead.
- in a [multi-server](../02-Server/using-multiple-nodes.md) setup, the `rooms` and `sids` objects are not shared between the Socket.IO servers (a room may only "exist" on one server and not on another).

## Room events

Starting with `socket.io@3.1.0`, the underlying Adapter will emit the following events:

- `create-room` (argument: room)
- `delete-room` (argument: room)
- `join-room` (argument: room, id)
- `leave-room` (argument: room, id)

Example:

```js
io.of("/").adapter.on("create-room", (room) => {
  console.log(`room ${room} was created`);
});

io.of("/").adapter.on("join-room", (room, id) => {
  console.log(`socket ${id} has joined room ${room}`);
});
```
