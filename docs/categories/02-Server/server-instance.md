The Server instance (often called `io` in the code examples) has a few attributes that may be of use in your application.

It also inherits all the methods of the [main namespace](../06-Advanced/namespaces.md#main-namespace), like [`namespace.use()`](../../server-api.md#namespaceusefn) (see [here](middlewares.md)) or [`namespace.allSockets()`](../../server-api.md#namespaceallsockets).

## Server#engine

A reference to the underlying Engine.IO server.

It can be used to fetch the number of currently connected clients:

```js
const count = io.engine.clientsCount;
// may or may not be similar to the count of Socket instances in the main namespace, depending on your usage
const count2 = io.of("/").sockets.size;
```

Or to generate a custom session ID (the `sid` query parameter):

```js
const uuid = require("uuid");

io.engine.generateId = (req) => {
  return uuid.v4(); // must be unique across all Socket.IO servers
}
```

As of `socket.io@4.1.0`, the Engine.IO server emits three special events:

- `initial_headers`: will be emitted just before writing the response headers of the first HTTP request of the session (the handshake), allowing you to customize them.

```js
io.engine.on("initial_headers", (headers, req) => {
  headers["test"] = "123";
  headers["set-cookie"] = "mycookie=456";
});
```

- `headers`: will be emitted just before writing the response headers of each HTTP request of the session (including the WebSocket upgrade), allowing you to customize them.

```js
io.engine.on("headers", (headers, req) => {
  headers["test"] = "789";
});
```

- `connection_error`: will be emitted when a connection is abnormally closed

```js
io.engine.on("connection_error", (err) => {
  console.log(err.req);	     // the request object
  console.log(err.code);     // the error code, for example 1
  console.log(err.message);  // the error message, for example "Session ID unknown"
  console.log(err.context);  // some additional error context
});
```

Here is the list of possible error codes:

| Code | Message |
|:----:|:-------:|
| 0 | "Transport unknown"
| 1 | "Session ID unknown"
| 2 | "Bad handshake method"
| 3 | "Bad request"
| 4 | "Forbidden"
| 5 | "Unsupported protocol version"

## Utility methods

Some utility methods were added in Socket.IO v4.0.0 to manage the Socket instances and their rooms:

- [`socketsJoin`](#socketsJoin): makes the matching socket instances join the specified rooms
- [Ì€`socketsLeave`](#socketsLeave): makes the matching socket instances leave the specified rooms
- [`disconnectSockets`](#disconnectSockets): makes the matching socket instances disconnect
- [`fetchSockets`](#fetchSockets): returns the matching socket instances

The [`serverSideEmit`](#serverSideEmit) method was added in Socket.IO v4.1.0.

Those methods share the same semantics as broadcasting, and the same filters apply:

```js
io.of("/admin").in("room1").except("room2").local.disconnectSockets();
```

Which makes all Socket instances of the "admin" namespace

- in the "room1" room (`in("room1")` or `to("room1")`)
- except the ones in "room2" (`except("room2")`)
- and only on the current Socket.IO server (`local`)

disconnect.

Please note that they are also compatible with the Redis adapter (starting with `socket.io-redis@6.1.0`), which means that they will work across Socket.IO servers.

### `socketsJoin`

This method makes the matching Socket instances join the specified rooms:

```js
// make all Socket instances join the "room1" room
io.socketsJoin("room1");

// make all Socket instances in the "room1" room join the "room2" and "room3" rooms
io.in("room1").socketsJoin(["room2", "room3"]);

// make all Socket instances in the "room1" room of the "admin" namespace join the "room2" room
io.of("/admin").in("room1").socketsJoin("room2");

// this also works with a single socket ID
io.in(theSocketId).socketsJoin("room1");
```

### `socketsLeave`

This method makes the matching Socket instances leave the specified rooms:

```js
// make all Socket instances leave the "room1" room
io.socketsLeave("room1");

// make all Socket instances in the "room1" room leave the "room2" and "room3" rooms
io.in("room1").socketsLeave(["room2", "room3"]);

// make all Socket instances in the "room1" room of the "admin" namespace leave the "room2" room
io.of("/admin").in("room1").socketsLeave("room2");

// this also works with a single socket ID
io.in(theSocketId).socketsLeave("room1");
```

### `disconnectSockets`

This method makes the matching Socket instances disconnect:

```js
// make all Socket instances disconnect
io.disconnectSockets();

// make all Socket instances in the "room1" room disconnect (and discard the low-level connection)
io.in("room1").disconnectSockets(true);

// make all Socket instances in the "room1" room of the "admin" namespace disconnect
io.of("/admin").in("room1").disconnectSockets();

// this also works with a single socket ID
io.of("/admin").in(theSocketId).disconnectSockets();
```

### `fetchSockets`

This method returns the matching Socket instances:

```js
// return all Socket instances of the main namespace
const sockets = await io.fetchSockets();

// return all Socket instances in the "room1" room of the main namespace
const sockets = await io.in("room1").fetchSockets();

// return all Socket instances in the "room1" room of the "admin" namespace
const sockets = await io.of("/admin").in("room1").fetchSockets();

// this also works with a single socket ID
const sockets = await io.in(theSocketId).fetchSockets();
```

The `sockets` variable in the example above is an array of objects exposing a subset of the usual Socket class:

```js
for (const socket of sockets) {
  console.log(socket.id);
  console.log(socket.handshake);
  console.log(socket.rooms);
  console.log(socket.data);
  socket.emit(/* ... */);
  socket.join(/* ... */);
  socket.leave(/* ... */);
  socket.disconnect(/* ... */);
}
```

The `data` attribute is an arbitrary object that can be used to share information between Socket.IO servers:

```js
// server A
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  socket.data.username = "alice";
});

// server B
const sockets = await io.fetchSockets();
console.log(sockets[0].data.username); // "alice"
```

### `serverSideEmit`

This method allows to emit events to the other Socket.IO servers of the cluster, in a [multi-server setup](using-multiple-nodes.md).

Syntax:

```js
io.serverSideEmit("hello", "world");
```

And on the receiving side:

```js
io.on("hello", (arg1) => {
  console.log(arg1); // prints "world"
});
```

Acknowledgements are supported too:

```js
// server A
io.serverSideEmit("ping", (err, responses) => {
  console.log(responses[0]); // prints "pong"
});

// server B
io.on("ping", (cb) => {
  cb("pong");
});
```

Notes:

- the `connection`, `connect` and `new_namespace` strings are reserved and cannot be used in your application.

- you can send any number of arguments, but binary structures are currently not supported (the array of arguments will be `JSON.stringify`-ed)

Example:

```js
io.serverSideEmit("hello", "world", 1, "2", { 3: "4" });
```

- the acknowledgement callback might be called with an error, if the other Socket.IO servers do not respond after a given delay

```js
io.serverSideEmit("ping", (err, responses) => {
  if (err) {
    // at least one Socket.IO server has not responded
    // the 'responses' array contains all the responses already received though
  } else {
    // success! the 'responses' array contains one object per other Socket.IO server in the cluster
  }
});
```


## Events

The Server instance emits one single event (well, technically two, but `connect` is an alias for `connection`):

- [`connection`](#connection)

### `connection`

This event is fired upon a new connection. The first argument is a [Socket instance](server-socket-instance.md).

```js
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  // ...
});
```
